# FAGAN Pattern Library

> 17 patterned-finding shapes distilled from the cycle-032 substrate-runtime session (PR loa-finn#157, merged 2026-05-04, b895f888) where Opus 4.7 reviewed twice (16 findings each, score plateau 23 → 23, no convergence) and GPT-5.5 via codex CLI reviewed once and surfaced 3 contract-violating issues neither Opus pass had found.

This file is FAGAN's pattern checklist. Reference it during review. Each pattern: surface signal · mechanism · named CVE family · one cycle-032 example. Severity defaults are FAGAN-binary (critical or major). Style/quality patterns are excluded — FAGAN doesn't review those.

---

## P1 · Capability check at load-time, not execution-time

**Surface signal**: search for a `validates X` step at one layer and `always provides X` at the layer below.

**Mechanism**: An authorization or capability check runs at LOAD time (parent loader, IAM evaluation), but the EXECUTION layer doesn't enforce. The check becomes a façade — present in the audit trail, absent on the actual control path.

**Severity**: critical (security)

**Named family**: CWE-285 missing authorization · BOLA · AWS S3 bucket-policy-vs-IAM split-brain.

**Example**: cycle-032 C1 — `worker-runtime.ts:createRuntimeForSlug` always merged both `modelRunnerLayer` + `eventWriterLayer` regardless of `manifest.requirements`. Capability bound enforced at parent loader, ignored at runtime composition.

---

## P2 · Identity must propagate per-invocation, not per-component

**Surface signal**: hardcoded `""` in metadata fields adjacent to dynamic `trace_id` or per-call values.

**Mechanism**: Runtime context (tenant_id, agent_id) is HARDCODED in a component built at boot, even though per-call options carry the values. Refactors that move identity propagation responsibility leave empty placeholders behind.

**Severity**: critical (multi-tenant isolation)

**Named family**: CWE-639 authorization bypass through user-controlled key. Atlassian 2018-class regressions.

**Example**: cycle-032 C2 — `metadata: { agent: "", tenant_id: "", nft_id: "", trace_id: subJobId }`. Three hardcoded empties next to one dynamic value. `runtimeOpts` carried `tenantId` to the worker but never reached `completionRequest`.

---

## P3 · Every async wait needs a timeout

**Surface signal**: `pendingX.set + postMessage/fetch` with no setTimeout. `new Promise((resolve, reject) => { register; send })` shape.

**Mechanism**: IPC/network/IO await with no bound. Missing response (parent crash, queue overflow, network blip) wedges the awaiter forever.

**Severity**: major (resource leak under fault conditions)

**Compounding hazard**: When combined with "defer dispose until in-flight is 0" patterns, unbounded wait → permanent leak.

**Named family**: CWE-833 deadlock. Connection-pool-during-shutdown (AWS Lambda extensions postmortem).

**Example**: cycle-032 C3 — `pendingBridgeRequests.set(...)` followed by `port.postMessage()` with no timer. Combined with F17's defer-dispose, missed response → permanent runtime leak.

---

## P4 · Verify and act on the SAME bytes the crypto check validated

**Surface signal**: `await someVerify(token, key)` followed by `token.split(...)` and a manual base64-decode.

**Mechanism**: Signature verification succeeds on input A, code manually re-parses A → A' and acts on A'. Any divergence between the two parsers is a parse-differential surface.

**Severity**: critical (auth bypass class)

**Named family**: SAML XML signature wrapping (CVE-2008-3437 + descendants), JWT alg confusion (auth0 jsonwebtoken CVEs 2015-2022). OWASP JWT cheat sheet "verify-then-use" rule.

**Example**: cycle-032 F10 — `compactVerify(token, publicKey)` succeeded, then code did `token.split(".")` + manual base64url decode. Fix: use compactVerify's returned `{ payload }` bytes.

---

## P5 · Test infra that swallows errors becomes invisible debt

**Surface signal**: `try { compile() } catch { fileExists() }` patterns. `--noEmitOnError false` flags. `|| true` in shell pre-checks.

**Mechanism**: Defensive `try/catch` in test setup or build infra continues on failed precondition. Real failures get hidden behind a "this passes vacuously" path.

**Severity**: major (broken bug-detection layer)

**Named family**: CI/CD black-hole-of-warnings antipattern. Linus Torvalds "do not silently swallow errors" doctrine.

**Example**: cycle-032 F5 — e2e test's `beforeAll` ran tsc with `--noEmitOnError false`, caught failure, then verified worker-entry.js exists. Real type errors in substrate code would silently emit broken JS; e2e ran against it.

---

## P6 · AsyncLocalStorage propagates through Promise chains, NOT through cached components

**Surface signal**: `als.run(value, async () => longLivedComponent.use())` where `longLivedComponent` was cached from a prior call.

**Mechanism**: ALS context-as-frame works only when the read happens INSIDE the active frame's Promise chain. A component cached across invocations that reads getStore() at construction-time (instead of at call-time) reads the FIRST invocation's snapshot — or null.

**Severity**: critical (incorrect-context-leak)

**Named family**: Datadog dd-trace 2021 (request-scoped context leaking between HTTP requests). OpenTelemetry's explicit `Context.with()` design choice.

**Example**: cycle-032 F1 — bridge proxy Layers cached in `runtimeCache` per slug, but proxy reads `invocationContext.getStore()` AT proxy-call time inside `Effect.tryPromise` — verified correct via regression test.

---

## P7 · Discriminated-union narrowing requires `--strict`

**Surface signal**: tsc invocations with explicit flag lists that don't include `--strict`. Test `beforeAll` hooks that compile sources standalone.

**Mechanism**: TypeScript narrowing semantics differ between strict and loose mode. `if (!parsed.ok)` narrows `ParsedArgs | ParseError` under `--strict` but produces TS2339 "property doesn't exist on union" under loose.

**Severity**: major (false-positive type errors block build, OR mask real type errors)

**Example**: cycle-032 F5 follow-up — e2e standalone tsc didn't include `--strict`. Adding the precondition surfaced 4 false-positive narrowing errors that were valid under the project's `--strict`. Fix: align test infra strictness with project tsconfig.

---

## P8 · Path-prefix matching needs trailing-separator guard

**Surface signal**: `Set<string>` of trusted prefixes + `for (const p of set) if (modPath.startsWith(p)) return true`.

**Mechanism**: `path.startsWith(prefix)` where prefix is `/foo` matches `/foo/bar` (correct) AND `/foo-evil/bar` (collision attack).

**Severity**: critical (path traversal class)

**Named family**: CVE-2019-14271 docker cp et al. CWE-22 path traversal.

**Example**: cycle-032 F4 — `registerTrustedPacksDir` correctly appended `sep` to make prefix `/trusted/packs/`. Test coverage for the explicit collision case was missing.

---

## P9 · Cross-model dissent is the gate, not depth-of-iteration

**Surface signal**: severity-weighted score equal across consecutive single-model iterations; finding IDs change but counts don't.

**Mechanism**: A single model reviewing the same code N times finds DIFFERENT compositions of issues at the SAME severity-budget level. The illusion of progress masks lack of convergence.

**Severity**: meta (this is FAGAN's reason for existing — the gate other reviewers can't be)

**Example**: cycle-032 BB iter-1 vs iter-2 — score 23 → 23 across two Opus passes. Adding 1 GPT-5.5 pass found 3 NEW contract-violating issues neither pass had surfaced.

**Doctrine**: For security/contract code, cross-model review is mandatory. For style/quality code, single-model multi-pass is acceptable.

---

## P10 · "Defer X until safe" needs explicit drain semantics

**Surface signal**: code that does "queue dispose until count==0" without a timeout backstop on what increments the counter.

**Mechanism**: The defer pattern is half the answer. The OTHER half is the trigger for the drain — and what happens if the trigger never fires.

**Severity**: major (composes with P3 to form permanent leaks)

**Example**: cycle-032 F17 + C3 interaction — F17 added defer-dispose. C3 found that without bridge-proxy timeouts, the in-flight counter never decremented, deferred dispose never drained.

**Doctrine**: When you ship "defer until safe", ALSO ship the timeout that bounds the wait. Treat as a pair.

---

## P11 · Fix-as-review-surface paradox

**Surface signal**: review iter-N+1 finds issues in code added by iter-N's fixes.

**Mechanism**: Every fix shipped becomes review surface. New tests, new comments, new patterns can themselves attract findings on the next pass.

**Severity**: meta (operator-stop guidance, not a code finding per se)

**Doctrine**: For single-model loops, operator-stop is the right termination signal. Score-plateau (kaironic stop) works in theory but in practice the same model finds new SHAPES at the same DEPTH. Cross-model is the answer.

---

## P12 · Hardcoded test fixtures become hardcoded prod values during refactors

**Surface signal**: code that has both a parameter (e.g., `runtimeOpts.tenantId`) AND a downstream usage hardcoded to empty.

**Mechanism**: Test fixtures use `""`, `"test-tenant"`, `0xdeadbeef`. Refactors that move values around lose tagging that says "this MUST be replaced before prod." Empty strings ship.

**Severity**: critical when in security/identity context, major otherwise

**Example**: cycle-032 C2 root cause — `tenant_id: ""` in metadata while `runtimeOpts.tenantId` carried the real value into the worker.

**Doctrine**: Tag test sentinels with `as const TEST_FIXTURE` brands. Never hardcode `""` in metadata fields; thread from real source or fail loud.

---

## P13 · Atomic operations are atomic ONLY when bookkeeping fits in atomic-rename

**Surface signal**: scripts/migrations described as "atomic" with phases AFTER the actual atomic step.

**Mechanism**: Multi-step "atomic" sequences (file swap + checksum bookkeeping + version-marker update) are atomic only for steps that fit within one rename or transaction commit. Failures after the rename leave partial state.

**Severity**: major (recovery path required)

**Example**: framework update v1.99.2 — Fetch → Validate → Migrate → Swap was labeled "atomic." The Swap (rename) was atomic, but the "Generate cryptographic checksums" phase after the swap hung on coprocess pipe under disk-full. Recovery via partial-state acknowledgment.

**Doctrine**: Treat the whole sequence as the operation. Document partial-state recovery. Add an idempotent "finalize" step.

---

## P14 · Single-writer semantics need explicit documentation

**Surface signal**: code that does "delete + set" or "read-modify-write" without locking, in a context where concurrent execution would be a bug.

**Mechanism**: Code safe under runtime assumption (e.g., "worker_threads = single-thread JS") becomes unsafe when lifted to multi-thread or distributed. Refactors don't always update the safety analysis.

**Severity**: major (latent race when assumption changes)

**Example**: cycle-032 worker-runtime.ts:284-292 — LRU eviction does delete + set. Comment: "worker_threads are single-threaded JS — no concurrent calls can interleave. If lifted to multi-thread/process pool, the delete+set sequence MUST be guarded by an async mutex."

**Doctrine**: Code correct only under a runtime assumption MUST document the assumption AND what would invalidate it.

---

## P15 · Dispatch-guard hooks at platform layer, not skill layer

**Surface signal**: rules in skill markdown that say "MUST NOT do X" with no PreToolUse hook backing them.

**Mechanism**: Instructions in CLAUDE.md / SKILL.md are advisory — agent reads and SHOULD follow. PreToolUse hooks fire at platform layer before tools execute — they ARE enforcement.

**Severity**: architectural (design-review territory, not code-review)

**Example**: loa /spiraling skill — SKILL.md says "MUST dispatch through harness pipeline" but ALSO ships `spiral-skill-sentinel.sh` (auto-creates dispatch sentinel) and `spiral-dispatch-guard.sh` (blocks code edits until harness runs). The hooks ARE enforcement; the SKILL.md is advisory.

**Doctrine**: For invariants that MUST hold, wire as platform hooks. Document advisory vs mechanical so reviewers know which layer the bug-class lives at.

---

## P16 · Findings reference IDs and finding-source for traceability

**Surface signal**: commit messages on a fix-iteration branch without finding IDs. `fix: address review feedback`.

**Mechanism**: Generic commit messages become unmoored from their justifying review iteration. Future readers can't walk back to the review.

**Severity**: process-class (not a code finding per se, but a PR-quality flag)

**Doctrine**: For any iterative review/fix cycle, commit messages MUST reference finding ID + reviewer source: `fix(F1, BB-iter1): ALS test for cached runtime`, `fix(C2, codex-gpt5.5): thread runtimeOpts via ALS`.

---

## P17 · The seven-layer test gap

**Surface signal**: security-touching code shipped without layer-6 (multi-model) review. Tests at layers 1-3 only.

**Mechanism**: Test layers catch different bug shapes:
1. unit · 2. integration · 3. e2e · 4. manual exploratory · 5. peer review · 6. multi-model adversarial · 7. production canary.

Most projects ship at layer 3-5. Layer 6 is what FAGAN/this construct addresses.

**Severity**: process-class (PR-quality flag for security-touching code)

**Doctrine**: For security-touching, contract-defining, or isolation-layer code, layer 6 is mandatory. For business logic, layer 5 is sufficient. The differentiator is "what's the cost of shipping a missed contract violation."

---

## How FAGAN uses these patterns

When reviewing a diff:

1. **Walk each pattern P1-P17 against the changed lines.** Does the code exhibit the surface signal?
2. **For each match, generate a finding** with file:line, current_code, fixed_code, explanation.
3. **Severity is binary**: critical (security/auth/parse-differential/multi-tenant) or major (correctness/lifecycle/concurrency). Style/quality patterns excluded — that's craft-gate (artisan) territory.
4. **Tag the named CVE family** when applicable. Anchors abstract concerns to concrete prior incidents.
5. **For meta-class patterns (P9, P11, P15, P16, P17)**: surface as design-review concerns at the SUMMARY level, not as line-anchored findings.
